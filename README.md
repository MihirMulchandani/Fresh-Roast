Fresh Roast is a modern restaurant website built around a simple idea:

a restaurant website should help people decide, not distract them.

No loud animations.
No fake booking systems.
No unnecessary features.

Just clear information, calm design, and a smooth experience.

What it is

Fresh Roast is a website for a full-service, 100% vegetarian restaurant.

It focuses on:

readability

performance

real-world usability

The goal is not to look impressive to developers,
but useful to customers and acceptable to the owner.

Design approach

Light-first design with an espresso / cream palette

Dark mode as an option, not a gimmick

Animations only where they add meaning

Text-first menu, images used sparingly

Mobile-first layout

If something slows down decision-making, it doesn’t belong.

Menu philosophy

The menu is structured by categories, not images.

Combos, mains, desserts, beverages, accompaniments

Prices are always visible

No PDFs as the primary menu

A printable menu image exists only as a secondary option.

Reservation flow

There is no backend booking system.

“Reserve Table” opens WhatsApp with a pre-filled message.

This reflects how small restaurants actually operate.

Tech stack

React (Vite)

CSS / Styled Components

No backend

Deployed on Vercel

Everything runs client-side.

Notes

Most restaurant websites fail by trying to do too much.
This one intentionally does less.

If a visitor can understand what the place is, what it serves, and how to visit within 30 seconds, the site has done its job.
